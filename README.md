# Volc Agent Launchpad

A minimal Agent platform for three-day middleware hackathons. It provides Agent
CRUD, a browser Playground, persistent workspaces, and Codex CLI backed by the
Volcengine Ark Responses API.

This submission implements **Agent Action Ledger**, crash-safe middleware for
one controlled side-effecting tool. A booking is recorded before execution,
called with a stable provider idempotency key, and reconciled after an ambiguous
failure so a resumed Agent does not create a duplicate.

Run it locally with Docker, Colima, or rootless Podman, or deploy it to
Volcengine ECS.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a single-user proof of concept with a mock booking provider. It does
> not make arbitrary shell commands transactional and is not a production
> booking or payment system. Do not use production data or credentials. See
> [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Features

- React and TypeScript Web UI
- Agent create, edit, start, stop, delete, and multi-turn chat
- Fastify control plane with asynchronous Run state
- Persistent Agent workspaces and Codex sessions
- Disposable Docker, Colima, or Podman container for each local turn
- Docker and Terraform deployment paths for Volcengine ECS
- Durable action ledger with run-scoped tool capabilities
- Provider-backed idempotency, retry replay, and startup reconciliation
- Controlled crash injection and a correlated recovery timeline

## Selected middleware: Agent Action Ledger

The protected failure window is:

```text
provider accepted the booking -> worker stopped -> local success not recorded
```

The mock provider persists independently from the control-plane ledger. On a
retry or restart, the coordinator queries the provider using the original
idempotency key and records the existing booking as the durable result. Gateway
requests may repeat; the provider side effect is created at most once.

### Three-minute demo

Set `ENABLE_FAILURE_INJECTION=true`, create an Agent, and select **Arm booking
crash**. Send this Playground task:

```text
Use the transactional booking tool to book SIN-NRT on 2026-09-15 for
traveler demo-alice. Use operation ID hackathon-demo-001. If the tool fails,
retry once using exactly the same operation ID, then report the booking ID.
```

The first attempt creates the mock provider booking and then hits the controlled
worker failure. The retry reconciles the provider record. The Action Ledger
panel shows preparation, execution, failure, recovery, and one provider booking.

See [the detailed demo and guarantee](docs/ACTION_LEDGER.md).

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- npm 10+
- Docker, Colima, or Podman
- A Volcengine Ark API key and endpoint that supports the Responses API

Codex CLI is included in the Runtime image and is not required on the host.

## Local browser SOP

### 1. Check the local tools

Install Node.js 22+ and one supported container engine, then verify them:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
docker --version        # Docker Desktop, Docker Engine, or Colima
podman --version        # Use this instead when running Podman
```

Only one container engine is required. Codex CLI is already included in the
Runtime image.

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url> volc-agent-launchpad
cd volc-agent-launchpad
```

Skip this step when already working from the repository root.

### 3. Start the POC

```bash
ARK_API_KEY=your-ark-api-key \
ARK_MODEL=ep-your-endpoint-id \
npm run poc
```

The first run installs Node.js dependencies and builds the Runtime image. The
script automatically selects Docker, Colima, or Podman.

### 4. Open the browser

Visit <http://localhost:3000>, or open it from the terminal:

```bash
open http://localhost:3000       # macOS
xdg-open http://localhost:3000   # Linux desktop
```

In the Web UI:

1. Select **Create Agent**.
2. Enter a name, description, and workspace instructions.
3. Select **Create Agent** again.
4. Enter a task in the Playground, for example:

   ```text
   Create a TypeScript hello-world CLI, add a test, and run it.
   ```

The Agent can write files, run commands, and continue the same Codex session in
later messages.

### 5. Stop and resume

Press `Ctrl+C` in the startup terminal. The script removes temporary Runtime
containers but keeps Agent workspaces and conversations.

- macOS state: `~/.volc-agent-launchpad/`
- Linux state: `.local/`
- Custom location: set `LOCAL_POC_DATA_ROOT`

Run the same `npm run poc` command to continue later.

### Select a specific container engine

Force Podman when multiple engines are installed:

```bash
CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman \
ARK_API_KEY=your-ark-api-key \
ARK_MODEL=ep-your-endpoint-id \
npm run poc
```

Colima uses `CONTAINER_ENGINE=docker` because it exposes the Docker CLI.

For a clean Linux host, follow the
[rootless Podman setup](docs/LOCAL_POC.md#rootless-podman-on-linux).

## Docker Compose

Create and edit the configuration:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap-local.sh
```

Required values in `.env`:

```dotenv
ARK_API_KEY=your-ark-api-key
ARK_MODEL=ep-your-endpoint-id
APP_AUTH_TOKEN=replace-with-at-least-24-random-characters
```

Start the application:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. Stop it without deleting Agent data:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Development

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm install --global @openai/codex@0.111.0
npm run dev
```

- Web UI: <http://localhost:5173>
- API: <http://localhost:3000>

Use local paths in `.env` when running outside Docker:

```dotenv
APP_DATA_DIR=.data
AGENT_WORKSPACE_ROOT=workspaces
CODEX_HOME=codex-home
```

## Deployment

- [Existing Linux ECS with Docker](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#existing-linux-ecs)
- [Complete Volcengine environment with Terraform](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#terraform-deployment)
- [Local Docker, Colima, and Podman details](docs/LOCAL_POC.md)

The existing-ECS script deploys from the current source tree:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.production
./scripts/deploy-existing-ecs.sh .env.production
```

The Terraform path provisions VPC, subnet, security group, ECS, and EIP:

```bash
cp deploy/volcengine/terraform.tfvars.example \
  deploy/volcengine/terraform.tfvars
./scripts/deploy-volcengine.sh
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ARK_API_KEY` | Required | Ark model API key. |
| `ARK_MODEL` | Required | Responses-capable endpoint or model ID. |
| `ARK_BASE_URL` | Beijing v3 endpoint | Ark OpenAI-compatible API URL. |
| `APP_AUTH_TOKEN` | Empty on loopback | Shared demo token; use 24+ random characters remotely. |
| `RUNTIME_PROVIDER` | `local-process` | `container` for disposable local Runtime containers. |
| `CODEX_SANDBOX_MODE` | `workspace-write` | Codex inner sandbox mode. |
| `CODEX_TIMEOUT_MS` | `600000` | Maximum duration of one turn. |
| `ENABLE_FAILURE_INJECTION` | `false` | Enables the controlled local crash demo. |
| `ACTION_GATEWAY_URL` | Runtime-specific | Optional Runtime-to-control-plane override. |
| `LOCAL_POC_DATA_ROOT` | Platform-specific | Local metadata, workspace, and session directory. |

See [.env.example](.env.example) for all Runtime and resource-limit options.

## How it works

    UI["React Web UI"] --> API["Fastify control plane"]
    API --> Store["JSON metadata and Agent workspaces"]
    API --> Runtime{"Runtime provider"}

    Runtime -->|ECS profile| Codex["Codex CLI in application container"]
    Container --> Ark["Volcengine Ark Responses API"]
    Codex --> Ark
```

The first turn uses `codex exec`; later turns resume the stored Codex thread.
Deleting an Agent archives its workspace under `workspaces/.deleted/`.

boundaries.

## Validation
